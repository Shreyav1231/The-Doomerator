# The-Doominator
For Boilermake XI

## **Inspiration**

As I got accepted into college: Surrounded by the bounds that hold the ones I follow, my eyes deceive me and my mind twists when I find out what society has become. **Us**, we are the future both in mind and in morals, we may not control what is past or present but **nothing** holds us back from the *REVOLUTION* of **our** new society. So I felt, the burning heart who sought out nothing but change. These chains bound me no longer, I can change the future that dictates this society, a broken society that's rotting on what was left. So you must be wondering where my inspiration comes from, why an application that keeps people away from a digital social life? Simply, to *save* the coming generations and enlighten them to a promising future. These days of depression is no longer, hope is in everyone and the time to search is **NOW**.

## **What it does**

It saves the minds of the young from further deterioration. With these important functions: First download the extension from google chrome store then enable tracking. Then it tracks how many scrolls you do on just social media sites. There is a dashboard that contains multiple different statistics like "amount of scrolls a day, a week, etc."

## **How we built it**

We used redis as a backend application for storing data purposes. We used multiple different applications including github, vscode, Html, javascript, css, chrome, etc. We used Aseprite for all the art used.

## **Challenges we ran into**

The project started as a plan to create a mobile phone app for android and IOS, slowly we became aware that none of us on the team knew any of the software needed to create a mobile app. This became a huge learning curve that pushed us back a whole day behind schedule. We continued to try learning the software but none of it seemed to stick. As almost half of the time passed, we still haven't done anything yet. So we decided to do something that we knew how to code, websites. We came up with the idea of a extension as it is similar to a mobile phone, except its connected to your browser. As a team who didnt know what they were doing more then half the time and had a teammate who has never touched code in her life, this team went through the whole challenge with no hope and only a couple hours of sleep in total.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of / What we learned**

We learned a lot about mobile apps and are more prepared to create one in the future. We managed to run on caffeine and barely sleep at all. We managed to create a working product with only a third of the time left in the challenge and no sleep. Personally we achieved a lot more then we were expecting, as a team who got together last minute and only decided their project an hour into the hackathon.

## **What's next for Doominator**

We are going to focus on creating our mobile app as an actual product over the summer which makes their revenue from advertisements.
